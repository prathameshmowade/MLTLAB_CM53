Title: Testing Custom Sentences with Confidence Scores

Aim:
To test the trained sentiment model on custom input sentences and interpret confidence scores.

Procedure:

Load trained sentiment model

Input custom sentences

Predict sentiment probabilities

Interpret confidence scores

Confidence Score Interpretation:

Score close to 1 → Positive sentiment

Score close to 0 → Negative sentiment

Score near 0.5 → Uncertain prediction

Observation:
The model provided probabilistic outputs which helped in understanding prediction certainty.

Conclusion:
Confidence scores are useful in analyzing how strongly the model predicts a sentiment.
