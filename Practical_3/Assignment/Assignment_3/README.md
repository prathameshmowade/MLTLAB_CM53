Title: Comparison of Dense Network and RNN

Aim:
To compare the performance of a Dense Neural Network and an RNN for sentiment analysis.

Models Compared:

Dense Neural Network

Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM)

Comparison Table:

Model	Accuracy	Observation
Dense NN	~40%	No sequence learning
RNN (LSTM)	~60%	Captures word order

Analysis:
The RNN model performed better due to its ability to learn contextual and sequential information from text.

Conclusion:
RNNs are more suitable for text-based sentiment analysis compared to simple dense networks.
