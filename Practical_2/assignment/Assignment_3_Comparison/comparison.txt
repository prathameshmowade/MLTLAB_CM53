Comparison:

CNN Accuracy   : 95.2%
Dense Accuracy: ~90%

The Convolutional Neural Network performs better than the
Dense Neural Network because CNN uses convolution and
pooling layers to extract spatial features such as edges,
curves, and shapes from images.

The Dense network treats all pixels independently and
does not capture spatial relationships, leading to lower
accuracy.

Hence, CNN is more suitable for image-based classification
tasks like handwritten digit recognition.
